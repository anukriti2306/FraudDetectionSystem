## 🧠 Introduction

Financial fraud has become increasingly prevalent in the digital age, with billions lost annually. Detecting fraud in real-time while maintaining user experience is a major challenge due to evolving tactics, large-scale data, and strict regulatory requirements.

## ❗ Problem Statement

Key challenges addressed:
- Real-time fraud decisioning
- High accuracy with low false positives
- Adaptability to new fraud tactics
- Explainable predictions
- High-volume transaction processing

## 📊 Research and Existing Solutions

### Traditional Methods
- Rule-based systems: Easy to explain but rigid and high-maintenance.
- Statistical models: Detect anomalies but fail at complex relationships.

### Machine Learning Methods
- **Supervised**: Random Forests, SVMs, Neural Networks — effective but often lack explainability.
- **Unsupervised/Semi-supervised**: Useful when labels are scarce, but prone to high false positives.

## 🧮 Proposed Algorithm

A **hybrid approach** combining:
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: Core ML model for initial fraud scoring.
- **Domain-Specific Heuristics**: Rules for high-risk behaviors (e.g., night-time transactions, high-value transfers).
- **Confidence Scoring**: Outputs probability with each prediction.

### Features:
- Time and amount scaling
- Encoded transaction types
- Custom fraud probability threshold (0.25)

### Pseudocode Overview
```python
If transaction_type == "transfer" AND amount > 800:
    fraud_probability += 0.2

```
## 🛠️ Implementation Details

**Language**: C++ style pseudocode (translatable to Python/Java)

**Core Structures**:
- `Transaction` class
- Feature vector (size 30)
- Decision Tree model with `predict_proba`
- Heuristic Rule Engine

## ⚙️ Performance Analysis

### ⏱️ Time Complexity
- **Overall**: `O(log n)` — dominated by decision tree traversal

### 🧠 Space Complexity
- **Overall**: `O(n)` — depends on number of decision tree nodes

### 📊 Empirical Results
- **Average transaction time**: 0.38 ms
- **Accuracy**: 96.7%
- **Precision**: 92.3%
- **Recall**: 89.1%
- **AUC**: 0.978
